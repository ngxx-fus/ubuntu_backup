Blocks ads on Facebook, Youtube and all other websites.","fullDescription":"AdGuard ad blocker effectively blocks all types of ads on all web pages, even on Facebook, YouTube, and others!\n\nWhat AdGuard ad blocker does:\n\n1. Blocks all ads: video ads (including YouTube video ads), rich media advertising, unwanted pop-ups, banners and text ads (including Facebook advertisements);\n2. Speeds up page loading and saves bandwidth, thanks to the missing ads and pop up windows;\n3. Blocks many spyware, adware, and dialer installers;\n4. Protects your privacy by blocking common third-party tracking systems;\n5. Protects you from malware and phishing.\n\nHow can AdGuard ad blocker protect your privacy?\n\nJust enable Tracking Protection filter in AdGuard settings. It completely removes all forms of tracking from the Internet. AdGuard has one of the largest tracker filters containing more than 5,000 rules.\n\nHow to remove social media with AdGuard?\n\nTired of all the «Like» buttons and similar widgets infesting all of your frequented web pages? Just enable AdGuard \"Social media filter\" and forget about them.\n\nHow can AdGuard ad blocker protect you from online threats?\n\nAt the moment we’ve got more than 2,000,000 harmful websites on record. AdGuard can block domains known to spread malware, protecting your computer against viruses, Trojan horses, worms, spyware, and adware. AdGuard really lowers the risk of virus infections and prohibits access to harmful websites to prevent potential attacks.\n\nWhy does AdGuard require permissions?\n\n    Access your data for all websites and Access browser tabs: both permissions are necessary for AdGuard to apply all kinds of cosmetic processing to the pages content. Naive ad blocking would simply block ad servers, and leave broken elements and first-party ads on the pages. AdGuard applies special cosmetic rules to make pages look clean and tidy.\n    Access browser activity during navigation: this permission is necessary to keep track of navigation events in order to apply rules when the time is right.\n\n\n==============================\n\nRelease notes:\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardBrowserExtension/releases\n\n==============================\n\nFree and Open Source:\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardBrowserExtension\n\n==============================\n\nFound a bug?

LanguageTool detects many errors that a simple spell checker cannot, such as grammar issues, commonly confused words, and punctuation oversights. Additionally, LanguageTool offers style suggestions to elevate your writing: synonym replacements for overused words, concise rephrasing of wordy sentences, and formal alternatives to commonly used expressions.\n\nLanguageTool is designed with simplicity in mind, instantly analyzing your text as you type. It is compatible with most platforms, including social networks such as Twitter and LinkedIn, and e-mail services such as Gmail.\n\nWith LanguageTool, our aim is to give users a full-feature grammar checker and proofreader that will enable them to have control and confidence over their content. While LanguageTool is a vital extension for non-native speakers, it also recognizes many mistakes that are frequently made by native speakers. This grammar and spelling correction works across several varieties of commonly spoken languages, and is capable of distinguishing between American and British English. LanguageTool also features a personal dictionary for exceptions or words that you might commonly use, but are not found in a conventional dictionary; it will learn to recognize these words for future grammar checking and proofreading.\n\nUnlike other services like Grammarly (a.k.a. Grammerly :-), QuillBot, and Ginger, LanguageTool supports more than 25 languages including English, Spanish, French, German, Polish, and Russian (see below for the complete list).\n\nYour privacy is important to us: By default, this extension will check your text by sending it to languagetool.org over a securely encrypted connection.

This WebExtension is inspired by Self Destructing Cookies. When a tab closes, any cookies not being used are automatically deleted. Keep the ones you trust (forever/until restart) while deleting the rest. Containers Supported","fullDescription":"Please don't use reviews for bugs, support request, or feature requests. Use GitHub instead.\n\nAs of Firefox 86, strict mode is not supported at this time due to missing APIs to handle the Total Cookie Protection. Also as of Firefox 103, standard mode has also enabled Total Cookie Protection. Use 'strict' mode if using pre-86, use standard mode for versions 86-102, or from version 103+ use the custom configuration and set cookie to 'cross site tracking cookies' option (not the cross-site cookies).\n\nBefore opening a GitHub Issue, please check the troubleshooting FAQ first. Note that support may not be available for variants of Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.\n\nPermission Request Explanations\n- Access your data for all websites: CAD requests this to delete cookies and other site data for all sites\n- Clear recent browsing history, cookies and related data: Ability to delete site data by domains.\n- Display notifications to you: Self explanatory.\n- Read and modify privacy settings: This setting has been removed since 3.4.0 and is kept here for historical reasons. Automatic detection of First Party Isolation support. Although the Privacy permission gives CAD \"read and modify\" permissions, NO MODIFICATIONS are done to your privacy settings, CAD only reads the setting of First Party Isolation. The privacy permission unfortunately cannot be given granular control, so this will stay for now.\n- Access browser tabs: CAD uses this permission to display the site hostname in the popup for easy whitelisting/greylisting, displaying the amount of cookies for that site, and which rules apply to that site.\n\nTake the permission wording with a grain of salt.\n\nMain Features\n- Auto Deletes Cookies from Closed (and/or discarded) Tabs\n- WhiteList/GreyList Support for domains\n- Easily Export/Import your Whitelist/Greylist and core settings\n- Clear All Cookies and site data for a Domain\n- Supports Manual Mode Cleaning from the popup\n- Easily See the Number of Cookies for a site\n- Support for Container Tabs (Firefox 53+ Only)\n\nUsage\nThis extension does not clean cookies automatically until you enable \"Auto-clean\". This gives you the chance to add sites to the WhiteList.\n\n1. Add the sites you want to keep cookies in the WhiteList (permanently) or GreyList (until Browser restart)\n2. Toggle \"Auto-clean\" in the popup or \"Automatic cleaning\" in the settings\n3. Watch those unused cookies disappear :)\n\nYou must enable cookies in the browser as this extension will replace the internal cookie manager.\n\nYou can disable Cleanup Notifications via the Settings.\n\nPopup Menu Features\nClean: This is basically a quick way of activating the Cookie Cleanup on demand. This looks at all your cookies and deletes them if they are not in any Open Tabs or the WhiteList.\nClean, include open tabs: Same thing as Cookie Cleanup except that it only deletes cookies only if they are not in the WhiteList. Open tabs are not taken into consideration.\nClear All Cookies for This Domain: Easy way to delete all cookies for one particular domain that you are on.\n\nSome things to Note:\n- This extension can clear localstorage as of version 2.1.0 and Firefox 58+. Enable it in the settings.\n\n- Even though third party cookies are cleared with this extension, it is better to disable third party cookies from the settings\n\n- Cleaning site data other than cookies within containers will have unintended side effects due to the current Web Extension API where attempting to clear a site data for one domain on a container will also clear that site data of the same domain on all containers.\n\nDocumentation\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nIf you have any other problem, file an issue on GitHub. Maybe we can work it out.
